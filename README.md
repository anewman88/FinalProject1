## Description

Group Project 1
SMU Programming Bootcamp Spring 2019

Planning an evening out can be challenging, especially when visiting a new or unknown city. Or sometimes you just want to know "What's Happening".  

What's Happening is a software application that works as a one-stop-shop for all your dining and entertainment planning needs including:
- Restaurant listings (by cuisine)
- Thing To Do like Movies, Sports, Concerts and Local Events 
- Nightlife choices such as clubs, live music, sports bars, etc

## Project Requirements 
- API's Used (all use AJAX)
    - Eventful 
    - Yelp
    - Zomato

- New library or technology
    - CSS animation on buttons
    - modals

- Repeating elements or table
    - The data returned from the API queries is filtered for appropriate 
    data and displayed in a table format that is easy to read

- Polished Front end
    - Page layout is simple and intuitive, yet informative
    - All button work (invoke something)
    
- Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts.   
    - The application uses a modal for Newsletter Signup

- Stackpath Boostrap used
    - yes!

- Deployed on Github at https://github.com/anewman88/FinalProject1/

- User Input Validation
    - The Newsletter Signup page verifies that the user inputs a name and a valid email address before being allowed to submit.

- Utilize Firebase for Persistent Data Storage
    - The list of available cities for search is stored in a Firebase database.  The Select City dropdown menu is dynamically populated from this data.  

- Good quality coding standards
  - of course!

## Problems/issues
- The Yelp API required the use of a proxy.  This took a while to figure out,  and we were able to make it work.
- We planned to store the submitted user data from the Newsletter Page, but Firebase only allows one database to be open per program on their "free" platform.
- We could not get the Weather widget to update when a new city was selected.  One more day and we would have had it working!
